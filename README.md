# Game of Life

-WORK IN PROGRESS-

My recreation of John Horton Conway's Game of Life in Ruby

## Rules:

1. Any live cell with less than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.

2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## To run tests:

`rspec`

## To run linter:

`rubocop`
